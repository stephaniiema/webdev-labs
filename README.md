# Labs for NU CS 396 Introduction to Web Development
Includes concept practice and partial implementations of various elements of PhotoApp.

## PhotoApp

PhotoApp is a photo sharing app inspired by Instagram. Functionality includes: following/unfollowing users from the sidebar, liking/unliking posts,  bookmarking/unbookmaking posts, commenting on posts, and a modal display which shows all of the comments under a post. A user must log in and can only see their own posts and posts from accounts they are following.
